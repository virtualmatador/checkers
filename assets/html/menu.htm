            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <h4>Start the Game</h4>
            <p>
                Hit <b>Play</b> button to navigate to the game page.
            </p>
            <h4>The Goal</h4>
            <p>
                Capture the opponent's pieces and keep your pieces in the game.
            </p>
            <h4>Rules</h4>
            <p>
                The small piece on the top of the game page, indicates the color of your pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
                The green arrow on the top of the game page, indicates your forward direction, either top or bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                The opponent's forward direction is the opposite of yours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each square has four adjacent squares: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
            </p>
            <p>
                If one of your pieces has an empty adjacent square at forward direction, it can move there without any capture.
            </p>
            <p>
                If one of your pieces
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    has an opponent's piece in adjacent square at forward direction
                </li>
                <li>
                    the next adjacent square at that direction is empty
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                it can leap over the opponent's piece, capture it, and move to the next empty square.
            </p>
            <p>
                If one of your pieces has made a capture, and it can make another capture, it must continue capturing as long as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have the option to capture, you cannot make a move that doesn't capture.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a piece reaches at the last row at its forward direction, it will promote to a king.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kings can go forward and backward. They are not limited to forward direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kings can pass any number of empty squares in each move. This is true for both before and after the leap when capturing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kings cannot leap over more than one opponent's piece in each capture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kings cannot leap over the same color pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kings cannot continue capturing immediately after promotion.
            </p>
